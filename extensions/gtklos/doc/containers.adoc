== Container widgets

A container is a widget that can contain other widgets. It permits to
create new windows or organize le layout of a multi widget GUI
component.


{{class-doc "window"}}
=== Class <window>

The `<window>` class defines a new window. By default, a new window is
mapped on the screen it is created and it's size is 200x200.

{{show-class-table <window>}}

All these slots have an associated accessor that can be used to read or
write the value of the slot. For instance

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> (define w (make <window> :title "A window"))
;; w
stklos> (title w)
"A window"
stklos> (set! (title w) "Title changed")
stklos> (title w)
"Title changed"
stklos>
----

{{class-doc "vwindow"}}
=== Class <vwindow>

A `<vwindow>` is a utility class. It is a window which contains a vertical box,
to arrange vertically some widgets in it. See example below.

{{show-class-table <vwindow>}}

// Note:: The classes `<%vbox>` and `<%box>` are special classes used to
// initialize a new `<vwindow>` object. They are not exported by the GTKlos
// library and are not meant to be used in a user program.


Example::

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> (define w (make <vwindow> :title "Vertical window" :width 400))
;; w
stklos> (dolist (b '("One" "Two" "Three")) (make <button> :text b :parent w))
stklos>
----

This will display the following window:

image::images/vwindow-figure.png[images/window-figure,align="center"]

Note:: Specifying that a button has `w` as parent permits to embed it in the `w` container.


{{class-doc "hwindow"}}
=== Class <hwindow>

A `<hwindow>` is a utility class. It is a window which contains an horizontal box,
to arrange horizontally some widgets in it.

{{show-class-table <hwindow>}}

// Note:: The classes `<%hbox>` and `<%box>` are special classes used to
// initialize a new `<vwindow>` object. They are not exported by the GTKlos
// library and are not meant to be used in a user program.


{{class-doc "gtk-box"}}
=== Class <gtk-box>

A `<gtk-box>` is a simple container which arranges child widgets into a single row or column, depending upon the value of `orientation` property.


WARNING: Normally, a class name prefixed by `<gtk-` is an internal class which is not exported bt the GTKlos library. This class name has been choose, because the name `<box>` is already used for the normal {{stklos}} boxes (see SRFI-111).

{{show-class-table <gtk-box>}}


Notes::

1. One of the most important slot o this class is the slot `orientation`
(not shown here, since it is inherited from the class `<gtk-orientable>`). Its
value is a symbol which can be one of the symbols `horizontal` or `vertical`.

2. Method `container-add!` accepts a list of keyword parameters after the
widget to add to the container. The possible values for these keyword parameters are:
    - `expand` (defaults to the value of slot `expand` slot of the box)
    - `fill` (defaults to the value of slot `fill` slot of the box)
    - `padding` (defaults to the value of slot `padding` slot of the box)
    - `end` (default to `#f`)


{{class-doc "hbox"}}
=== Class <hbox>

This utility class can be used to define a `<gtk-box>` whose orientation is
initialized to `horizontal`.

{{show-class-table <hbox>}}


{{class-doc "vbox"}}
=== Class <vbox>

This utility class can be used to define a `<gtk-box>` whose orientation is
initialized to `vertical`.

{{show-class-table <vbox>}}

{{class-doc "frame"}}
=== Class <frame>

A <frame> widget surrounds its child with a decorative frame and an optional label.

{{show-class-table <frame>}}

Notes::

- The `title` slot contains the label of the frame
- The `shadow` slot value can be one of the following symbols `none`, `in`, `out`, `etched-in` or `etched-out`.
- The `xalign` and `yalign` flots can be used to adjust the position of the label.


{{class-doc "hframe"}}
=== Class <hframe>

This utility class permits to define a frame which contain an horizontal box
that can be filled with components that are arranged horizontally.

{{show-class-table <hframe>}}

{{class-doc "vframe"}}
=== Class <vframe>
This utility class permits to define a frame which contain an vframe box
that can be filled with components that are arranged vertically.


{{show-class-table <vframe>}}

{{class-doc "grid"}}
=== Class <grid>

A `<grid>` widget is a container which arranges its child widgets in rows and columns, with arbitrary positions and horizontal/vertical spans.

{{show-class-table <grid>}}

Note:: Method `container-add!` accepts a list of keyword parameters after the
widget to add to the container. The possible value for these keyword parameters are:
     - `left` is the column position of the added widget (starting from 1)
     - `top` is the line position of the added widget (starting from 1)
     - `width` is the width position of the added widget
     - `height` is the height position of the added widget


Example::

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> (define w (make <window> :title "Grid demo"))
;; w
stklos> (define g (make <grid> :parent w))
;; g
;; Create 5 buttons
stklos> (define b (map (lambda (x) (make <button> :text x :width 200))
               '("Button #1" "Button #2" "Button #3" "Button #4" "Button #5")))
;; b
;; Add them to the grid
stklos> (container-add! g (list-ref b 0) #:left 0 #:top 0 :width 2)
stklos> (container-add! g (list-ref b 1) #:left 0 #:top 1)
stklos> (container-add! g (list-ref b 2) #:left 1 #:top 1 :height 2)
stklos> (container-add! g (list-ref b 3) #:left 0 #:top 2)
stklos> (container-add! g (list-ref b 4) #:left 0 #:top 3)
stklos>
----

This will display the following window:

image::images/grid-figure.png[images/grid-figure,align="center"]


{{class-doc "header-bar"}}
=== Class <header-bar>

A `<header-bar>` is similar to a horizontal `<gtk-box>`. Furthermore, this widget
can add typical window frame controls, such as minimize, maximize and close
buttons, or the window icon. It is often used at the top of a `<vwindow>`

{{show-class-table <header-bar>}}

Notable slots::
- *decoration-layout* is a string used to indicate the layout of the buttons
   (see example below)
- *decoration-layout-set* is a boolean used to know if the decoration layout
   has been set
- *show-close-button* indicates if the decoration buttons (not only the close
   button!!) are shown or not. Its default value is `#f`

Exemple::
The following example illustrates the use of a header bar.

[source,scheme]
----
(define w (make <vwindow> :width 400))

(define h (make <header-bar> :title "I'm the title"
                             :subtitle "I'm the subtitle"
                             :parent w
                             :decoration-layout "minimize,maximize:close"
                             :show-close-button #t))

(define l (make <label> :text "I'm the content of the window"
                        :parent (list w :expand #t)))
----

Execution of this code will display the following window


image::images/header-figure.png[images/header-figure,align="center"]

Notes::

1. The `decoration-layout` slot is set here to `"minimize, maximize:close"` to place

   - the _minimize_ and _maximize_ buttons on the left (since they are before
     the `':'` character)
    - the _close_ button on the right (since it is after the `':'` character)
2. The `show-close-button` is set to `#t` so display the control buttons
3. The `parent` is set here to `w` with an indication that it must be expanded
into it container (`w` here). See the documentation of `parent` of the
<<class-gtk-widget, `<gtk-widget>` class>>.


<<<
{{class-doc "toolbar"}}
=== Class <toolbar>

A `<toolbar>` is container whose constituents are instance of the
`<toolbar-item>` class.

{{show-class-table <toolbar>}}

Slots::

- *expand* is a boolean. It indicates if toolbar items are expanded or not
   (default to `#f`)
- *icon-size* can be one of the following symbols `small`, `medium`, `large`
   or `huge`
- *show-arrow* is the boolean. It indicates if the toolbar as an overflow menu.
- *toolbar-style*: can be one of the following symbols `icons`, `text`,
   `both` or `both-horizontal`.

Notable method::

The method *add-items-to-toolbar* is a utility method to easily populate the
components of a toolbar. It takes a toolbar and a list describing its
components with the following convention, for each item of the list:

1. an empty list specify to add a new separator, that is an instance of
`<toolbar-separator-item>`, to the toolbar
2. a list specifies that a new `<toolbar-icon-item>` must be created and added
to the toolbar. The content of the list are the parameters that must be passed
during the creation of the icon.

[source,scheme]
----
(define w (make <vwindow> :title "Test header" :width 300))
(define tb (make <toolbar> :parent w))

(add-items-to-toolbar tb                            ;; populate the toolbar
 '((:text "Play"  :icon-name "media-playback-start")
   (:text "Pause" :icon-name "media-playback-pause")
   ()  ;; <== A separator
   (:text "Stop" :icon-name "media-playback-stop")))
----

Execution of this code will display the following window

image::images/toolbar-figure.png[images/toolbar-figure,align="center"]

Notes::

1. For the sake of simplicity, the buttons are inactive here (use the
`command` slot to add an action when the toolbar button is clicked).

2. Icons her are stock buttons they are searched by the GTK library in the
standard directory (generally `/usr/share/icons` on GNU/Linux).

3. Since `<gtk-toolbar>` inherits from `<gtk-orientable>`, a toobar can be
horizontal or vertical.


{{class-doc "toolbar-item"}}
==== Class <toolbar-item>

The `<toolbar-item>` class is the parent class of the toolbar items classes
that can be added to a to a GTK toolbar. It offers only one method
(*container-add*) to add an item to a toolbar.


{{show-class-table <toolbar-item>}}

There are two methods of the generic function *container-add!* to add an item
to a container:

 - with 2 parameters, the methods permit to append the new item at the end of
    already added items.
 - with 3 parameters, the method adds the given item at the position given as
   third parameter (an integer). If the position is 0 the item is prepended to
   the start of the toolbar. If it is negative, the item is appended to the
   end of the toolbar.




{{class-doc "toolbar-separator-item"}}
==== Class <toolbar-separator-item>

The class `<toolbar-separator-item>`  permits to define a separator to a toolbar.

{{show-class-table <toolbar-separator-item>}}




{{class-doc "toolbar-button-item"}}
==== Class <toolbar-button-item>

The class `<toolbar-separator-item>` permits to define a button to a
toolbar. The button can have an image and a text.

{{show-class-table <toolbar-button-item>}}

Methods::

- *command* is identical to the command associated to a button. See the
   documentation of <<button, buttons>>.

- *icon-name* is a string which contains is the name of the themed icon
   displayed on the item.  Icons are searched by the GTK library in the
   standard directory (generally `/usr/share/icons` on GNU/Linux).

- *text* is the text of the button item.
