GTKlos permits to access to the GTK canvas widget if the library
`GooCanvas 3` is installed {{stklos}} is configured.  `GooCanvas` is a
canvas widget for GTK+ that uses the Cairo 2D library for drawing. It
has a model/view split, and uses interfaces for canvas items and
views.

Methods::
- *initialize-instance* initializes the given canvas.

=== Canvas Items

Canvas items (rectangles, ellipses, ...)  are the components that are
displayed in a canvas widget. To add a canvas item in a given canvas, you just
need to set the parent of the canvas item to this canvas.

{{class-doc "canvas-rectangle"}}
==== Class <canvas-rectangle>

A `<canvas-rectangle>` represents a rectangle item. Since it is a subclass
_<gtk-canvas-item>_, it inherits all of the style properties such as `x`, `y`,
`fill-color` or `line-width`.

{{show-class-table <canvas-rectangle>}}

Slots::

- *radius-x* is the horizontal radius to use for rounded corners.
- *radius-y* is the vertical radius to use for rounded corners

Method::

- make-canvas-item {{see-make-canvas-item}}

Example::

[source,scheme]
----
(define w (make <vwindow> :title "Rectangle demo"))
(define c (make <canvas> :parent w :width 400 :height 300))

(define r1 (make <canvas-rectangle> :parent c
                 :x 50 :y 50 :width 100 :height 80 :fill-color "red"))

(define r2 (make <canvas-rectangle> :parent c
                 :x 120 :y 70 :width 140 :height 150
                 :stroke-color "orange" :radius-x 20 :radius-y 20
                 :line-width 5
                 :fill-color "rgba(0,0,255,0.7)"))
----

Here, we define two rectangles, a red one `r1` and a (partially transparent)
blue one `r2`. We obtain:

NOTE: Canvas items receive event signals as standard GTK widgets. For instance
we can define a behavior when entering in `r1` or when cliking `r2`


[source,scheme]
----
(event-connect r1 "enter-notify-event"   (lambda ignore (eprintf "Entering r1\n")))
(event-connect r2 "button-release-event" (lambda ignore (eprintf "Clicked r2\n")))

- *center-y* is the y coordinate of the center of the ellipse
- *radius-x* is the horizontal radius of the ellipse
- *radius-y* is the vertical radius of the ellipse

Method::

- *make-canvas-item* {{see-make-canvas-item}}.

[source,scheme]
----
(define w (make <vwindow> :title "Ellipse demo"))
(define c (make <canvas> :parent w :width 400 :height 300))
(define e1 (make <canvas-ellipse> :parent c
                 :center-x 100 :center-y 80 :radius-x 80 :radius-y 30
                 :fill-color "red"))
(define e2 (make <canvas-ellipse> :parent c
                 :center-x 180 :center-y 150 :radius-x 100 :radius-y 100
                 :line-width 5 :stroke-color "orange"
                 :fill-color "rgba(0,0,255,0.7)"))

{{class-doc "canvas-line"}}
==== Class <canvas-line>

A `<canvas-line>` represents a line item. More exactly,it is a poly-line item
which is a series of one or more lines, with optional arrows at either end.

{{show-class-table <canvas-line>}}


Slots::

- *arrow-length* is a float which represents the length of the arrows, as a
   multiple of the line width.
- *arrow-tip-length* is a float which represents the length of the arrow tip,

- *start-arrow* indicates if an arrow should be displayed at the start of the
   poly-line.

Method::

- *make-canvas-item* {{see-make-canvas-item}}.
