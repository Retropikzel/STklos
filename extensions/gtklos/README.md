# GTKlos extension


This extension gives access to the GTK+ toolkit using the OO layer available in STklos. You need to have GTK+3 installed to use it. This extension also defines a canvas widget. You need to have the *goocanvas* library installed to use canvases (this library is often not installed by default).

The `demos` directory contains some demos which can be run individually or by using the `run-demos` script in this directory, particularly if you have never installed STklos before:

```sh
$ ./run-demos &
```
