== Introduction

This extension gives access to the functions of the _libcurl_ library, the
multiprotocol file transfer library which comes with the famous
http://curl.se[cURL package].

When the STklos cURL extension library is installed, it will be available as a
normal {{stklos}} library. It can be imported with the following stance:

```scheme
(import (stklos curl))
```

Hereafter is a simple function which uses the *curl* library:

[#lowlevel]
```scheme
(define (print-content url)
  (let ((handle (curl-init)))              ; <1>
    (curl-set-option handle #:url url)     ; <2>
    (curl-set-option handle #:verbose #t)  ; <3>
    (curl-perform handle)                  ; <4>
    (curl-cleanup handle)))                ; <5>
```

Here, we have:

<1> create a new CURL handle. This function must be called before any connection.

<2> add option to the current handle. The `#:url` option used here
tells curl the URL of the text we want to grab. The libcurl uses a
long list of options that can be passed here. This is the only option
that must be set, as otherwise there can be no transfer.

<3> Add another option (be verbose) for this transfer. Any number of option can be added
 before starting data transfer.

<4> Perform the data transfer as described by the previous options.

<5> `curl-cleanup` must be called to end the CURL session and free the
resources used by `_libcurl_ for the transer


NOTE: For more information on the available options, see
https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html[curl_easy_setopt
manual page]. To use an option, such as `CURLOPT_XYZ`, you can use the
keyword `\#:xyz` or `#:XYZ` (case doesn't matter here in fact). +
 +
Note that not all the options are supported for now. Only the options
which use a string or an integer as parameter are handled by the `
curl-set-option` function.


Calling `(print-content "https://example.com")` permits to display the HTML
content of the site `https://example.com`.

To grab the content of a given site, you can use the primitive
`get-content-as-string` which is described below.

== The (stklos curl) library


=== Low level primitives

This section describes the exported symbols of the `(stklos curl)` library
whiche are (more or less) a direct port of the primitives of the
https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-easy[Easy Interface] of _libcurl_. The main
primitives which fall in this category are the ones used in
<<lowlevel,previous exemple>>.



{{doc-title 'extended '(curl-version) "(curl-version)"}}

Returns the version of libcurl as a string
```scheme
(curl-version)
   => "libcurl/7.81.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1m zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.5.2 libidn2/2.3.2 libpsl/0.21.1 (+libidn2/2.3.0) libssh2/1.10.0 nghttp2/1.46.0"
```


{{doc-title 'extended '(curl-init) "(curl-init)"}}

This function must be the first function to call, and it returns a CURL handle
that you must use as input to other functions in the _libcurl_ interface. This
call *MUST* have a corresponding call to `curl-cleanup` when the operation is
complete.


{{doc-title 'extended '(curl-set-option) "(curl-set-option handle key value)"}}


This function permits to tell libcurl how it must do the transfer. It takes an
`handle` obtained by a previous call to `curl-init`, a keyword `key`
specifying the option that must be set and the value `val` that must be given
to this option. The type of `val` depends of the options to be set (see the
https://curl.se/libcurl/c/easy_setopt_options.html[_libcurl_ documentation]
for complete list settable options).

NOTE: For now, the current version of the library can only set _libcurl_
options which accepts a string or an integer (a long for _libcurl_) . Boolean
values can also be used for integer parameters (they are converted to 0 and
1). As a special case; Scheme ports can also be passed with the options on ports
explained below.

*Passing ports to `curl-set-option`*:

By default, `libcurl` uses the system standard ports for its IO. They can be
changed with special options which cannot easily be used in Scheme. As a
consequence, `curl-set-option` has been extended to accept the following keywords:

- `#:iport` can be used to set the Scheme port where the input must be read.
- `#:oport` can be used to set the Scheme port where the output must be written.
- `#:eport` can be used to set the Scheme port where the error messages must be
   written.

For instance, the following piece of code permits to grab the content of
`https://example.com` as a string:

```scheme
(import (stklos curl))

(let ((out (open-output-string))
      (handle (curl-init)))
  (curl-set-option handle #:url "https://example.com")
  (curl-set-option handle #:oport out)    ;; place the output in the 'out' string port
  (curl-perform handle)
  (curl-cleanup handle)
  (get-output-string out))
```


{{doc-title 'extended '(curl-perform) "(curl-perform handle)"}}

Performs the transfer as described in the options given before with
`curl-set-option` on the given CURL `handle`. The entire request is
done and returns when done, or earlier if it fails.


{{doc-title 'extended '(curl-cleanup) "(curl-cleanup handle)"}}

Closes the current session started with th `handle` obtained with a
previous `curl-init`. It closes all the connections kept open by
`handle`.

NOTE: The _libcurl_ documentation says: _Do not call this
function if you intend to transfer more files, re-using handles is a
key to good performance with libcurl_.


=== The curl primitive

{{stklos}} offers a high level function, called `curl,` which embodies
all the low level details necessary to use the _libcurl_ library.

{{doc-title 'extended '(curl)
              "(curl url)"
	     "(curl url key~1~val~1~ ...)"}}

The `curl` function creates a new session on the string `url`. By
default, this function uses the current input, output and error port
(instead of the system `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` ports used by
the _libcurl_ library. Consequently, the redirection of Scheme ports
is effective with this function. Furthermore, by default, this
function also set the flags

- `#:followlocation` which allows to follow a possible redirection sent by the
   server with a HTTP header 3xx response.

- `#:referer` which defines a value for the `Referer:` header of a HTTP
  request.  The value is something like "STklos-curl/xxx" where `xxx` is a
  sub-string of the value given by `curl-version`. This option is set because
  some server refuse to respond to requests when there is no referer.

**Exemples:**

Grab a file by FTP an store its content in the file `"/tmp/out"`

```scheme
(let ((p (open-output-file "/tmp/out")))
  (curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-27.2.tar.gz.sig" :oport p)
  (close-output-port p))
```

The following expression in equivalent of the `(slurp "http://example.com")`
call in Clojure, which returns the content of `example.com` site as a string.

```scheme
(with-output-to-string
  (lambda ()
    (curl "http://example.com")))
                          => "<!doctype html>\n ... </html>\n"
```


Use a HTTP POST request with `foo=1` and `bar=2`, using the `http://httpbin.org` site

```scheme
(curl "https://httpbin.org/post" #:postfields "foo=1&bar=2")
```

The JSON answer will be something like:

```json
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {
    "bar": "2",
    "foo": "1"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "11",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "Referer": "STklos-curl/libcurl/7.81.0",
  },
  "json": null,
  "origin": "134.59.216.151",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"
}
```
