// == Preface

{{empty-line 10}}
This document provides a complete list of procedures and special forms
implemented in version *{{version}}* of {{stklos}}. The language
implemented by {{stklos}} is nearly compliant with the language
described in the Revised^5^ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
(aka {{rfive}}) <<R5RS>>.

However, since version 1.30, the goal is to make it more compliant
with {{rseven}} <<R7RS>>. This document states the compliance of each
construction relatively to these reports, or if it is a {{stklos}}
extension.
