(((pattern Matching)))

Pattern matching is a key feature of most modern functional
programming languages since it allows clean and secure code to be
written. Internally, "pattern-matching forms" should be translated
(compiled) into cascades of "elementary tests" where code is made as
efficient as possible, avoiding redundant tests; {{stklos}} "pattern
matching compiler" provides this :footnote[The "pattern matching
compiler" has been written by Jean-Marie Geffroy and is part of the
Manuel Serrano's Bigloo compiler since several years <<Bigloo>>. The
code (and documentation) included in {{stklos}} has been stolen from
the Bigloo package v2.4 (the only difference between both package is
the pattern matching of structures which is absent in {{stklos}}.

The technique used is described in details in C. Queinnec and
J-M. Geffroy paper <<QuG92>>, and the code generated can be considered
optimal

The "pattern language" allows the expression of a wide variety of patterns,
including:

 * Non-linear patterns: pattern variables can appear more than
   once, allowing comparison of subparts of the datum (through `eq?`)
 * Recursive patterns on lists: for example, checking that the
   datum is a list of zero or more ``a``s followed by zero or more ```b``s.
 * Pattern matching on lists as well as on vectors.


=== The Pattern Language
((("pattern language")))
The syntax for `<pattern>` is:

[:small]
|===
| <pattern>                   | Matches:

|  <atom>                     | the <atom>.
| (kwote <atom>)              | any expression eq? to <atom>.
| (and <pat~1~> ... <pat~n~>)   | if all of <pati> match.
| (or <pat~1~> ... ...<pat~n~>) | if any of <pat~1~> through <pat~n~> matches.
| (not <pat>)                 | if <pat> doesn't match.
| (? <predicate>)             | if <predicate> is true.
| (<pat~1~> ... <pat~n~>)      | a list of n elements. Here, ... is a
                                  meta-character denoting a finite repetition
                                  of patterns.
| <pat> ...                   | a (possibly empty) repetition
                                  of <pat> in a list.
| #(<pat> ... <pat~n~>)       | a vector of n elements.
| ?<id>                       | anything, and binds id as a variable.
| ?-                          | anything.
| ??-                         | any (possibly empty) repetition of anything in a list.
| ???-                        | any end of list.
|===

*Remark:* `and`, `or`, `not` and `kwote` must be quoted in order to be treated
as literals. This is the only justification for having the `kwote` pattern
since, by convention, any atom which is not a keyword is quoted.


**Explanations Through Examples**


* `?-` matches any s-expr.
* `a` matches the atom `'a`.
* `?a` matches any expression, and binds the variable `a` to
  this expression.
* `(? integer?)` matches any integer.
* `(a (a b))` matches the only list `'(a (a b))`.
* `???-` can only appear at the end of a list, and always succeeds.
  For instance, `(a ???-)` is equivalent to `(a . ?-)`.
* when occurring in a list, `??-` matches any
  sequence of anything: `(a ??- b)` matches any list whose
  `car` is `a` and last `car` is `b`.
* `(a ...)` matches any list of `a`'s, possibly empty.
* `(?x ?x)` matches any list of length 2 whose `car` is *_eq_* to its `cadr`.
* `((and (not a) ?x) ?x)` matches any list of length 2 whose `car` is
   not *_eq_* to `'a` but is *_eq_* to its `cadr`.
* `#(?- ?- ???-)` matches any vector whose length is at least 2.

IMPORTANT: `??-` and `...` patterns can not appear inside a vector, where you
should use `???-` +
For example, `{{sharp}}(a ??- b)` or `#(a...)` are invalid
patterns, whereas `{{sharp}}(a ???-)` is valid and matches any vector whose first
element is the atom `a`.

=== {{stklos}} Pattern Matching Facilities

Only two special forms are provided for this in {{stklos}}: `match-case` and
`match-lambda`.
