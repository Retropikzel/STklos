{{chapter "Foreign Function Interface"}}
(((FFI)))
The {{stklos}} Foreign Function Interface (FFI for short) has been
defined to allow an easy access to functions written in C without
needing to build C-wrappers and, consequently, without any need to
write C code.  Note that the FFI is very machine dependent and that it
works only on a limited set of architectures/systems footnote:[FFI
system should works on the following architectures/systems:
gcc_ppc_osx, gcc_sparc_unix, gcc_x64_unix, gcc_x86_unix.]. Moreover,
since FFI allows very low level access, it is easy to crash the
{{stklos}} VM when using an external C function.

*Note that the support for FFI is still minimal and that it will
evolve in future versions.*

The definition of an external function is done with the
`define-external` special form.  This form takes as arguments
a typed list of parameters and accepts several options to define the
name of the function in the C world, the library which defines this
function, ... The type of the function result and the type of its
arguments are defined in <<ffi_types>>. This table lists
the various keywords reserved for denoting types and their equivalence
between the C and the Scheme worlds.

{{insertdoc 'define-external}}

Hereafter, are some commented definitions of external functions:


```scheme
 (define-external isatty ((fd :int))
     :return-type :boolean)

  (define-external system ((cmd :string))
    :return-type :int)

  (define-external ttyname (:int)
    :return-type :string)
```

All these functions are defined in the C standard library, hence it is not
necessary to specify the `:library-name` option.



* *_istty_* is declared here as a function which takes an
  integer and returns a boolean (in fact, the value returned by the
  C function *_isatty_* is an *_int_*, but we ask here to the FFI
  system to translate this result as a boolean value in the Scheme
  world).
* *_system_* is a function which takes a string as parameter
  and returns an *_int_*.
* *_ttyname_* is a function whih takes an int and returns a string.
  Note that in this function the name of the parameter has been omitted
  as within C prototypes.

If an external function receives an `:int` argument and is passed a
Scheme bignum, which then doesn't fit a *_long int_* in C, the
external function will signal an error. When a `:float` or `:double`
argument is declared and is passed a Scheme real that requires so many
bits so as to not be representable in that type, that argument will be
silently taken as infinity.

```scheme
 (define-external c-abs ((fd :int))
     :entry-name "abs"
     :return-type :int)

 (define-external c-fabs ((fd :double))
     :entry-name "fabs"
     :return-type :double)

 (define-external c-fabsf ((fd :float))
     :entry-name "fabsf"
     :return-type :float)
```

We can now use the function we have just defined:

```scheme
(c-abs (- (expt 2 70)))    => Error
(c-fabs -1.0e+250)         => 1e+250
(c-fabsf -1.0e+250)        => +inf.0
(c-fabs (- (expt 10 300))) => 1e+300
(c-fabs (- (expt 10 600))) => +inf.0
```

WARNING: *We need to describe `malloc` and `malloc_atomic` and their
interaction with the GC*
