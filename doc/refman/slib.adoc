{{chapter "Using the SLIB package"}}
((("require")))
((("provide")))
https://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/slib/slib/[SLIB] is a library for
the programming language Scheme, written by Aubrey Jaffer.
It uses only standard Scheme syntax and thus works on many different
Scheme implementations. 

To  use this package, you have just to type

```scheme
(require "slib")
```

and follow the instructions given in the *_SLIB_* library
to use a particular package.

NOTE: *_SLIB_* uses also the _require_ and _provide_ mechanism to load
components of the library. Once *_SLIB_* has been loaded, the standard
{{stklos}} `require` and `provide` are overloaded such as if their parameter
is a string this is the old {{stklos}} procedure which is called, and if their
parameter is a symbol, this is the *_SLIB_* one which is called.
