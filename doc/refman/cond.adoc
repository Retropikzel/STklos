{{chapter "Exceptions and Conditions"}}


=== Exceptions
(((exception)))
The following text is extracted from {{link-srfi 34}}, from which
{{stklos}} exceptions are derived. Note that exceptions are now part of {{rseven}}.

Exception handlers are one-argument procedures that determine the action the
program takes when an exceptional situation is signalled. The system
implicitly maintains a current exception handler.

The program raises an exception by invoking the current exception handler,
passing to it an object encapsulating information about the exception. Any
procedure accepting one argument may serve as an exception handler and any
object may be used to represent an exception.

The system maintains the current exception handler as part of the dynamic
environment of the program, akin to the current input or output port, or the
context for dynamic-wind. The dynamic environment can be thought of as that
part of a continuation that does not specify the destination of any returned
values. It includes the current input and output ports, the dynamic-wind
context, and this SRFI's current exception handler.

=== Conditions
((("condition")))
The following text is extracted from {{link-srfi 35}}, from which
{{stklos}} conditions are derived.

Conditions are values that communicate information about exceptional
situations between parts of a program. Code that detects an exception may be
in a different part of the program than the code that handles
it. In fact, the former may have been written independently from the
latter. Consequently, to facilitate effective handling of exceptions,
conditions must communicate as much information as possible as
accurately as possible, and still allow effective handling by code
that did not precisely anticipate the nature of the exception that
occurred.

Conditions available in {{stklos}} are derived from *SRFI-35* and in this SRFI
two mechanisms to enable this kind of communication are provided:



* subtyping among condition types allows handling code to
determine the general nature of an exception even though it does
not anticipate its exact nature,
* compound conditions allow an exceptional situation to be
described in multiple ways.

Conditions are structures with named slots. Each condition belongs to
one condition type (a condition type can be made from several
condition types). Each condition type specifies a set of
slot names. A condition belonging to a condition type includes a
value for each of the type's slot names. These values can be
extracted from the condition by using the appropriate slot name.

((("&condition")))
There is a tree of condition types with the distinguished `&condition`
as its root. All other condition types have a parent condition type.

Conditions are implemented with {{stklos}} structures (with a special bit
indicating that there are conditions). Of course, condition types are
implemented with structure types. As a consequence, functions on
structures or structures types are available on conditions or
conditions types (the contrary is not true). For instance, if C is a
condition, the expression
```scheme
(struct->list C)
```
is a simple way to see it's slots and their associated value.

=== Predefined Conditions
((("SRFI-35")))
((("SRFI-36")))
{{stklos}} implements all the conditions types which are defined in
{{link-srfi 35}} and {{link-srfi 36}}.
However, the access functions which are (implicitely) defined
in those SRFIs are only available if the file `"conditions"` is
required. This can be done with the call:

```scheme
(require "conditions")
```

Another way to have access to the hierarchy of the {{link-srfi 35}}
and {{link-srfi 36}} condition:

```scheme
(require-extension conditions)
```

The following hierarchy of conditions is predefined:

```
&condition
   &message (has "message" slot)
   &serious
   &error
      &error-message (has *message*, "location" and "backtrace" slots)
      &i/o-error
         &i/o-port-error (has a "port" slot)
            &i/o-read-error
            &i/o-write-error
            &i/o-closed-error
        &i/o-filename-error (has a "filename" slots)
            &i/o-malformed-filename-error
            &i/o-file-protection-error
                &i/o-file-is-read-only-error
            &i/o-file-already-exists-error
            &i/o-no-such-file-error
     &read-error (has the "line", "column", "position" and "span" slots)
```
